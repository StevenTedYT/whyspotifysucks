        <h1>Uh why does Spotify suck?</h1>
        <h3>1.</h3>
        <p>The price: It's actually one of the most expensive streaming platforms.</p>
        <h3>2.</h3>
        <p>They don't pay small artists. Small artists are the ones who need money to improve their skills/quality and promotions strategies.</p>
        <h3>3.</h3>
        <p>The design is outdated and trashy (this depends on the person, but it's a personal opinion)</p>
        <h3>4.</h3>
        <p>You need to pay for vewing lyrics of a music (wait wtf??)</p>
        <h3>5.</h3>
        <p>Displaying the number of streams influences whether people listen to a song. We tend to think that if a song doesn't have many streams, it must be bad, which isn't necessarily true. When stats aren't visible, we don't have a preconceived notion and can listen to the music with an open mind, forming an opinion based on the music itself, not on its statistics.</p>
        <h3>6.</h3>
        <p>The algorithms are trash and manipulated by big labels and advertising companies like Coca. More informations: <a href="https://youtu.be/NXBWkLjFHRQ?si=mubEi-vOd0r5_BMk&t=512" target="_blank">here</a></p>
        <h3>7.</h3>
        <p>Currently, no lossless audio, and you might need to pay extra for it in the future. [<a href="https://youtu.be/NXBWkLjFHRQ?si=mubEi-vOd0r5_BMk&t=512" target="_blank">source</a>]</p>
        <h3>8.</h3>
        <p>No Dolby Atmos aka Spatial Audio</p>
        <h3>9.</h3>
        <p>No music videos.</p>
        <h3>10.</h3>
        <p>No DJ sets or concerts.</p>
        <h3>11.</h3>
        <p>No synchronisation for local music (for example, if you add music, it's not automatically added to all your devices).</p>
        <h3>12.</h3>
        <p>No smart playlists (custom automatic playlists based on rules you choose).</p>
        <h3>13.</h3>
        <p>Owned by people who work in advertising technology, not the music industry.</p>
        <h3>14.</h3>
        <p>Low royalties for artists (one of the lowest, by the way).</p>
        <h3>15.</h3>
        <p>Poor audio quality (maximum is 320 kbps); Apple Music, Deezer, and Tidal offer much better audio quality.</p>
        <h3>16.</h3>
        <p>Artists need to pay to sync lyrics with their music.</p>
        <h3>17.</h3>
        <p>Artists can only pitch one track per album, meaning only one track can be featured in algorithmic playlists like "Discover Weekly" or "Release Radar."</p>
        <h3>18.</h3>
        <p>No BPM or key coherence in the recommendation system when Spotify selects the music.</p>
        <h3>19.</h3>
        <p>No true shuffle play option.</p>
        <h3>20.</h3>
        <p>The free version isnâ€™t really usable. While I understand that they need to generate revenue for artists, it might be better to offer only a premium version. Ads are one thing, but many of the features are locked behind a paywall.</p>
        <h3>21.</h3>
        <p>Podcasts wtf they are doing here? This is supposed to be a music platform, right?</p>
